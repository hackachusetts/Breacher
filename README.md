# Breacher
Breacher uses the haveibeenpwned API to search for multiple email data leaks.

In order to use breacher you will first have to purchase an API key from https://haveibeenpwned.com/. 
The number of emails that may be searched at any given time depends on your API plan. This current version only allows up to 10 per minute, since that is the rate-limit for their least expensive subscription.
